## About

I solve problems by developing and maintaining great software.

My passion for learning has driven me to work with a variety of technologies in a variety of industries, growing both personally and professionally along the way. I work hard and do what needs to be done, whether it's leading a team or being a great supporter. I am constantly working to improve myself, the quality of my work, and the people around me.
