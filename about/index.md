I solve problems by developing and maintaining great software.

My passion for learning has driven me to work with a variety of technologies in a variety of industries, growing both personally and professionally along the way. I work hard and do what needs to be done, whether it’s leading a team or being a great supporter. I am constantly working to improve myself, the quality of my work, and the people around me.

I’ve built web applications across the full stack with ASP.NET, Java, AngularJS, jQuery, and React (with & without Redux). I’ve also built mobile applications, both hybrid and native, with Xamarin, Ionic, and Cordova.

I'm currently working at Headspring in Austin, Texas. All opinions are my own.
